New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 21. This example
extends the [January 11 Example](https://dbetebenner.github.io/D3_01112017/) Rhode Island click-to-zoom example
to be a full chloropleth with the colors indicating number of tested students. The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization
were created by me using [shape files](https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/) provided by the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
